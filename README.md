# MappingBot
1. Store data in containers "categories" (chemistry, physics)
2. Containers must have a connection with each other (chemistry-> H2O), (physicis->Mass), (H2O + Mass = 18 g/mol)
3. add or connect data, .url, pictures with eachother
4. search function with ability to see the connections (mass of H2O,H2O properties)
